# simple-php-event-management
This is a simple php based event management system . It's a prototype model of the system . I am trying to develop it such a way thus any one can easily install it on his own server and working perpose

#Installation
Put all the files , folders in your directory/host.
Open config.php file. There are 4 DEFINE functions . Put Database name by overrite on "event" word, then put your host in "localhost" , and so on, for in "root" provide database user name and then put the last "" provide your database password. 

That's it then just open the index.php file on browser and you are ready to go.
Thanks.
